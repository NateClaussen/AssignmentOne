				HTML, CSS, and JavaScript each have their own role and purpose

				<p>
					HTML is the scripting language which stands for Hyper Text
					Markup Language. It uses tags to organize the page into
					different sections. With the introduction to HTML5, there
					are now many new tags that help organize your code even
					more! (i.e.) &lt;main&gt;&lt;/main&gt;. You can use CSS and
					JavaScript inline if you would like to.

				<p>
					CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is used to
					make your website beautiful! It can be done in a separate
					stylesheet or inline in the HTML document. There are many
					different uses that CSS can be used for. One of the
					strengths of CSS is it separates the decoration from the
					visual. It can also be used to make responsive pages; pages
					that change depending on the size of your screen

					JavaScript
					<span class="LanguageLogo"
						><img
							src="/images/JavaScriptLogo.jpg"
							alt="JavaScript Logo"
					/></span>
				</h3>
				<p>
					JavaScript is the brain of the website. Using JavaScript you
					can manipulate what the user sees without having to refresh
					the page. You can use it to add interactive elements that
					the user can click on or hover over, which can make your
					website much more interesting and engaging
