			<h1>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h1>
			<p>
				HTML, CSS, and JavaScript each have their own role and purpose
				in a website!
			</p>
			<h3>HTML</h3>
			<p>
				HTML is the scripting language which stands for Hyper Text
				Markup Language. It uses tags to organize the page into
				different sections.
			</p>
			<h3>CSS</h3>
			<p>
				CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is used to make
				your website beautiful! It can be done in a separate stylesheet
				or inline in the HTML document. There are many different uses
				that CSS can be used for. One of the strengths of CSS is it
				separates the decoration from the visual. It can also be used to
				make responsive pages; pages that change depending on the size
				of your screen
			</p>
			<h3>JavaScript</h3>
			<p>
				JavaScript is the brain of the website. Using JavaScript you can
				manipulate what the user sees without having to refresh the
				page. You can use it to add interactive elements that the user
				can click on or hover over, which can make your website much
				more interesting and engaging
