			<h1>UI -VS- UX</h1>
			<div class="InfoBox">
				<h4>What is the UI?</h4>
				<p>UI stands for "User
				Interface". It includes visual elements such as the pages,
				buttons, pictures, etc. that people see. It is not concerned about how it flows with the other elements on the page. It also does not care if there are any interactive elements, just that everything looks pretty!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="InfoBox">
				<h4>What is the UX?</h4>
				<p>UX stands for "User
				Experience" with the product. This includes how different
				components interact, and how that feels to the end user. The UX DOES care about how things flow, and how user friendly your application is</p>
